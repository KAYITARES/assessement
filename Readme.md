#### By **KAYITARE Cynthia**
## Description
the website is created using css for the design,html for the structure and Javascript for its function, where user enter the 3 number value of the length and the system help them to knownm the name of the triangle based on the value he/she enter.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* must have computer or smart phone
* having bundle to access the internet
* open the browser and type on your browser the following link

## BDD(Behavior-Driven Development)
### The following is what my program should handle:

| Behavior | Input Example |Numerical Example| Output Example |
| :----:   | :-----------: | :------------: | :---------------|
|triangle is isoscele| any two side are equal|12; 1; 12|Isoscele Triangle     |
|triangle is equilateral| all side are equal|12; 12; 12| Equilateral Triangle|
|triangle is scalene|all 3 sides is not equal |12 ; 13; 14| Scalene Triangle|
|is not a triangle | the sum of any two sides is less or equal to the third  |50; 5; 4|Not a Triangle|
|triangle must have 3 sides with positive definate length!|make 3 positive number | 12|triangle must have 3 sides with positive definate length!|

## SPECS
* The program should accept input from the user
       * input example:3,3,3
       * output:the triangle is equilateral
* The program should accept only 3 positive numbers
       * input example:12
       * output:a triangle must have 3 sides with positive definate length!
 * The program should accept return when triangle is not been created
       * input example:40,5,3
       * output:is not a triangle
 * The program should respond if the triangle is equilateral
       * input example:12,12,12
       * output:the triangle is equilateral      
  * The program should respond if the triangle is isosceles
       * input example:12,1,12
       * output:the triangle is isosceles        
       
  * The program should respond if the triangle is scalenes
       * input example:12,13,14
       * output:the triangle is scalenes
